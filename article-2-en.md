# Impressionism for Product Thinking

Impressionism isn’t just a painting style—it’s a way to ship products that **feel** alive.
Here’s a lightweight framework inspired by brush, light, and atmosphere.

## 1) Brushstrokes → Micro-moments
Design with visible strokes: small, honest interactions that don’t hide their edges.
- Typing echoes back quickly
- Progress hints are never silent
- Defaults are opinionated but gentle

## 2) Light → Guidance, not force
Light reveals form. Let information architecture guide users without shouting.
- One clear primary path per view
- Secondary actions fade into the periphery
- Motion hints where to look next

## 3) Atmosphere → Emotional coherence
A product’s tone is its weather. Keep it consistent.
- Palette with purpose (calm → confident)
- Copy with rhythm (short → warm)
- Time-aware states (first run / return / low energy)

**Ship note**: Sketch the experience first in words, then in boxes, only then in pixels. The order matters.
